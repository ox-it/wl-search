wl-search
=========

There is another repository for solr of wl-solr-search which contains a fuller history of the work that was done. The previous workflow was todo work in that repository and then shortly before release copy a snapshot of it across into this repository squashing the history. Nested git repository was the previous setup although we could use a subtree.
