<h2>Basic Search</h2>
<p>The Search Tool is designed to provide a search faclility to content within tools within a worksite or course.
It achieves this by creating an index of all content that other tools decide to make available to the search tool.
This index is updated automatically, so as content is added to the worksite or course, it will be indexed.</p>
<p>
For example, if the worksite or course has an email list, as emails are posted to the list, the content of those emails
will be indexed and become searchable in the search tool.
</p>
<p>
On the search tool 'search' page, you will find an entry box. To perform a search, simply enter the words that you want to search for.
The search tool will then perform search based on those terms. 
</p>
<p>
When the search is performed it will only return items form the current worksite or course where the 
tool has been placed. 
The hit results are ranked acording to a relevance score. This score is based on
the proximity of the words, and the frequencey of the words within the content. 
If there are more than 10 results, the results wil be paged, and you can browse through the 
pages by selecting the page number to view.
</p>
<p>
The search tool performs some basic analysis on the words you enter, for instance it will ignore
frequently occouring terms like <em>I, the, and</em> and will reduce words to their stem word. 
</p>
<blockquote>
For example, if you search
for <em>cowslips</em>, the search tool will recognise the stem of the word as <em>cowslip</em> and search for all words with that stem,
i.e. <em>cowslip, cowslips</em>. 
</blockquote>
<p>
This process is called stemming.
</p>
<p>
As has been mentioned the search tool ignores the boolean operators, but if you want to 
improve the search you can prefix with + or -, indicating the search <em>must contain</em> or <em>must not contain</em> the 
following word, respecively. 
<blockquote>
For Example, if you search for <em>+cowslips -bluebells</em>, 
the search engine will generate a the query <em>documents must contian the stem cowslip and must not contain the stem bluebell</em>
</blockquote>
