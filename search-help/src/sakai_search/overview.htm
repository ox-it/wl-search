<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Search Tool is designed to provide a search faclility to content within tools within a worksite or course.
It achieves this by creating an index of all content that other tools decide to make available to the search tool.
This index is updated automatically, so as content is added to the work site or course, it will be indexed.</p>
<p>
For example, if the worksite or course has an email list, as emails are posted to the list, the content of those emails
will be indexed and become searchable in the search tool.
</p>
<p>
On the search tool 'search' page, you will find an entry box. To perform a search, simply enter the words that you want to search for.
The search tool will then perform search based on those terms.
