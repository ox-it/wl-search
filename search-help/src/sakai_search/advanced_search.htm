<h2>Advanced Search</h2>
<p>The Search Tool is driven by an index that contains multipl sub indexes. Whne using the tool for basic search only
2 of these indicies are used. The <em>context</em> index, and the <em>content</em> index. The <em>content</em> index contains a 
stored and tokenized full text index of a digested form of the content. This means that a Word document, uploaded to resources will have had
all its text extracted and indexed, whereas a video package may have had only the metadata indexed. When the search results are returned, it is 
this content that is highlighted with the matching terms.
</p>
<p>
The <em>context</em> index provides and keyword index of the source of the content. This is the worksite or course id which contains the content. 
When the search tool performes a basic search it prepends a search term of <em>+content:&lt;currentsiteid&lt;</em> where &lt;currentsiteid&gt; is the 
context or siteid where the search is being performed. This can be translated as <em>results must come from the current site</em>.
</p>
<p>
If performing and advanced search you can search for terms within any of the indexes. For example to search only in announcements you can use
the search terms <em>+tool:announcement +content:cowslip</em> which will only return announcements containing the word cowlisp.
</p>
<p>
The index currently contains the following named indexes.
</p> 
<ul>
<li>
<b>content:</b> A Tokenized, stored index of the digested content of the search documents
</li>
<li>
<b>context:</b> A Keyword stored index of the source context of the search document.
</li>
<li>
<b>tool:</b> A Keyword stored index of the tool name producing the search document.
</li>
<li>
<b>title:</b> A Tokenized stored index of the title of the search document.
